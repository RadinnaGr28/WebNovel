According to estimates of a 2008 survey over 50% of both women and men were overweight.</h3>
<h3 id="chapter-line-3">Being overweight or obese can have a serious impact on health. Carrying extra fat leads to <br>

                        disorders, and some cancers. These conditions cause premature death and substantial disability.</h3>

    <h3 id="stress-title">STRESS</h3>
    <h2 id="chapter-line-2">A very high percent of people with eating disorders tend to hate themselves.<br>
        They are not capable of noticing the beauty of the outer world, because they are too<br>
        overwhelmed with their inner world. While all kinds of stressing thoughts go around their mind,<br>
        in the end they find themselves in the trap of the depression. Their depressive thoughts directly affect<br>
        the function of their body and this leads to negative changes in their physical health.</h3>
    <h3 id="chapter-line-4">It is no surprise that DESSERTS spelled backwards is STRESSED.</h3>

<!-- NINGTH CHAPTER START (THE WAKE UP)--> 
<div id="container9" class="container"></div>
    <h1 id="chapter-title-2" id="link9">Wake up!</h1>
    <h3 id="chapter-line-2">Stress is defined “neither an environmental stimulus, a characteristic of the person, nor a response<br> 
                            but a relationship between demands and the power to deal with them without unreasonable or destructive costs.”</h3>
    <h3 id="chapter-line-2">Dopamine or the “happy hormone” is a neurotransmitter. It is produced by our body and plays a major role in nerve cells’<br> 
                            connections. When being happy, dopamine is triggered and the serotonin produces hormones in our body that reduce pain perception.<br>
                            However, when being in the state of despair or any other negative emotion, the serotonin does not produce those hormones anymore.<br>
                            Therefore, our body needs a quick recover, because the dopamine cannot do its job properly anymore. When feeling weak, we tend to turn to<br>
                            the most accessible way to deal with this problem – in our particular case, this is FOOD. When you lost something that gave you satisfaction<br>
                            and love, you start looking for substitutes like drugs, food, alcohol and etc.</h3>
    <h3 id="chapter-line-2">But technically, any other way to increase the happy hormone works in the same way. You just have to find something which gives you the satisfaction <br>
                            the food does. It might be some sport, favorite hobby, friends, family, sleep, parties, sex and etc. This is the key to defeat eating disorders.
    <h3 id="chapter-end-line">This is what we MUST realize before we take action.</h3>
